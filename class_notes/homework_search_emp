Part 1:

Search for an employee by ID
Check that the correct record returns
Ensure only 1 record returns

Part 2:

Use google to figure out how to send the ESCAPE key after typing 'David' to close the autocomplete widget that opens up.
Check that all results match

OR

Part 2B (advanced challenge):
Search for an employee by name: amb
Check that EITHER first name or last name column of the results matches
