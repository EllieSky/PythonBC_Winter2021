Homework

Part 1:

login
click on the "First (& Middle) Name" header of the table
    Hint: it's a link so you can locate it By.LINK_TEXT
wait for the sort to complete
    Hint: there are 2 ways, but you will need to figure this out yourself
loop and assert that the records are in alpha order by first/middle name
    Hint: hrm sort is case insensitive and python is case sensitive.
Do this for the 1st page ONLY

Part 2:
Add logic that continues to checks sort order across multiple pages.
    Hint: if there are less than 50 records, there is no pagination element
    Hint: Do not assume that max pages will always be 2... it could be any amount (12, 20, etc)

Have fun!!!
